to the Dean of Peiixv3t11e‚ and to six other persons; if the Arch-
deacon (or liis Official›‹ agxe anx trouble, the others were to act, in
order to punish the said Arelideacon fol his CO11tumacy.¹ In the
end the King md the Bishop pievailed. No particulars are
given, but we find Kirkeby Rector of Camborne subsequently.‘·'
The Bislxop instituted to Tawstock on the 13111 of May, to Ohagford
on the 281311, 10 Lanix-et on the 29111 3 and in each case his Mandate
for induction was couched in the same threatening terms 3 but no
trouble seems to have arisen in any of these cases.

It will be remembered³ that on the 251311 of March, when the
Commissaries of the Archbishop proceeded to Clyst, intending to
serve a formal Citation 011 Bishop Brantyngham, they were met by
an armed band of the Bishop's adherents, who not only repelled
them from the Manor-House but pursued them for a considerable
distance along the Topsham—road, and grievously maltreated them.
The Archbishop immediately excommunicated the ringleaders of
this disgraceful business, and we cannot doubt that he kept his eye
on them during the Visitation, though they are not again referred
to in the record of its progress. Doubtless, they were in hiding,
impenitent, and unwilling to submit. But later in the year,
and some time after the Archbishop had left Devonshire and was
engaged in the Visitation of other Dioceses‚ they came to a better
mind, and proceeded to Gloucester, where, in the Choir of the
Abbey-Church, they appeared before the Archbishop, on the 2nd of
November, and made their Submission. They were then and there
absolved ,· but they were lequired to appear before the Archbishop
again on the 18111 of the month, wherever 116 might happen to be
within his Province‚ to receive their Penance. And they had to
journey all the way to Lambeth for this purpose, where, in the
Private ChapeL a most severe Penance was enjoined, involving
them in serious expenses, trouble, and inconvenience. The particulare
of the case are recorded at length in Courtenay's Register (fol. 114),
and, being· of considerable interest, must find a place here,—
