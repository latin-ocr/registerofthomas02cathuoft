Lawhitton, and W yke- St. Maly 111 Νο1·111 Cornwa113 and in North
Devon Hartland Abbey, Great Tor1ington, and Parkham. On the
18111 01 September he held his third General Ordination, at Exeter,
and on the lSth of December and the 2nd of April following he
ordained at Crediton.l In October he visited the Collegiate Church
of Ottery, and dedicated a new Church at ])61·1111011111,2 within the
Parish of Townstal.

Early in 1373 116 was obliged to return to his official duties in
London. WVe find him at &Vestminster on the 2nd of May, and in
his London-House, or at Faringdon, till the end of July, when he
came back to his Diocese and immediately resumed his j0u1·neys
to scattered centres of work in the two Counties. In May,
1374, and again in May, 1375, he ran up to London (if I may
80 8657), 11111 for a few days only on each occasion; and he
was, practically‚ resident in the Diocese till the end of the latter
year, engaged all the time, continuously‚ in the same arduous
labours, shewing himself to his people, and making his influence
felt, everywhere.

Thus far I have followed the Bishop's movements and indicated,
in some detail, the extent 01 1118 journeys and work, work accom-
plished under singular difficulties and with manifold embarrassing
interruptions; desiring to show how it was started, and persevered
in wit-h manifest devotion and diligence. It is not necessary, how-

divided between his two great spheres 01 work. He was appointed
Treasurer of the Exchequer, as I have said, in June, 13693 and I
have given, above, the dates of his visits to London down to 1116
beginning 01 1375. Returning to Clyst, he Visited his Cathedral
early in August of that year3 and then set out, almost imme·
diately, for Cornwall‚ and devoted several months, continuously,
to visiting a large number 01 places in both Counties, moving
rapidly from place to place, as on former occasions. In May, 1376,
he was summoned to London, where he remained till the middle
of Jqu, when he retuined to Cly,st by way 01 Salisbury and
