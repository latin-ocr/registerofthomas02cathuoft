NOTE.

It will be observed 'chat the reference-figures in the Index of BENEFICES are
not arranged consecutively. This is due to the fact that they refer to several
separate Registers‚ while, for obvious reasons, they are arranged in chrono-
logical order. No fewer than seven folios have been cut out of bhe Regist-er
of Institutions, with the result than many Entries have been lost irrevocably.
In most of these caseS, however, the names of the Incumbents and the
approximabe dates of their Institution have been recovered from the Register
of Commissions and of Royal Letters, and from numerous incidental references
in the ‘⁶ Registrum Commune.” See page 138.
