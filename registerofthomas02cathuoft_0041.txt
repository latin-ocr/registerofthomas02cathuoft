PREFAOE. xxxiii

EXETER,¹ and he was instituted by the Bishop on the &th of May‚²
though the Archbishop had already admitted him, on the 6th of
April. On the lst of May, John Marcheford was presented to the
Prebend of anmms in the Chul-ch of CHULMLEIGH by the Lady
Margaret Courtenay, who directed the Letter of Presentation to
heffson, the Archbishop‚ who instituted him on the 4th of May.3
Apparently, Courtenay⁷s action was disputed, for the Institu-
tion was repeated (on the Presentation of the said Countess of
Devon, “our mother'’), on the llth of June.⁴¹ The Prehend is
described as that which Sir william Lye recently held. Now, Sir
William Leye was instituted to this Prebend on the 18th of Sep-
tember, 13825 and on the 9th of March, 1392-3, the Bishop insti-
tuted Robert del Skires, in succession (not to Marcheford but) to
the said William de Lee, the Patron on this occasion being the
King, illa viem ignoring altogether what the Archbishop had done.⁵
On the l3th of May, the Archbishop collated John Cobthorne to
the Rectory of ST. JAMEs's‚ ΕΧΕΤΕκ, “jure in hac parte devoluto '² ;
and there seems to have been no dispute on this occasion. The case
of the important Rectory of CAMBORNE was strongly contested, as
there were rival Patrons, the Archbishop siding with one of them,
and the Bishop with the other. On the lst of May, Sir William
Nevylle, Knight, presented to the former, Robert Nevylle, B.C.L.,
and on the llth the Archbishop directed the Archdeacon of Cornwall
and his Official to hold an Inquisition as to the vacancy. Their
Return is dated on the 13th; they found that Sir John Luky, the
last Rector, died on the 20th of April3 that Sir William Basset,
Knight, had assigned the Presentation to Sir william Nevylle, Knigl1t5
Robert Nevylle, whom he had presented, was aged 30 years and more;
he had the First Tonsure, and was not otherwise beneficed. Ac-
cordingly the Archbishop instituted him, and issued a Mandate, on
the l3th of May, for his Induction.6 But on the lst of May the
Bishop had instituted John de Kirkeby, of the Diocese of York, on
the Presentatiom hac vioe, of the King, as Guardian of the lands
and heir of the late Sir william Basset. And he directed his
Mandate for Kirkeby’s Induction to the Archdeacon and his OfficiaL

circumstances, as precautionary mensures, when there was a change of Bishops
or of Patrons. But in this case the circumstances were not ordinary3 and
the Diocesan Bishop denounced and ignored the Archbishop’s proceedffigs,
issuing on the 9th of April a 11Ιίιηι1ῑιιρ-ιι ne quis admittatur ad Ecclesiam
Sancti Laurencii '' except by his own authority or that of the Apostolick See,
and ordering the parishioners not to receive or obey John Avery as their Rector,
