PREFAcE. xvii

of April, 1384! He then issued a Commission (dated at Exminster
on the 16111) 10 Adam de Μο11111111, “ad cognoscendum et proceden—
dum super detectis.'' But, meanwhile, the Bishop had become sus-
picious that his Diocesan rights and jurisdiction were being seriously
infringed. He, probably, resented the terms and the manner of his
personal examination when Courtenay visited the Cathedral on the
l4th of March3 for on the 18111, only four days later, he issued a
General Mandate, directed to all his “ subditi '' throughout the
Diocese, forbidding them 10 obey the Archbishop.2 This, of course,
meant open vax-ianoe between the contending parties 3 and the Arch-
bishop lost no time in replying to the Bishop's challenge 3 for on the
same day he directed to the Archdeacon of Exeter his “Mandatum
Inhibitorium contra p1·en]issa.''3 The Bishop, too, was 011 the alert;
and on the selfsame day his ‘⁴ Prima Provocacio ”4 was affixed to the
doors of the Cathedral, together with his “Prima Appellacio—a
gravaminibus nobis et subditis nostris per . . . Archiepiscopum
(salva reverencia ei debita) injuste illatis.'’ These Instruments
seem to have been torn down by the partisans of the Archbishop,
for similar Documents were affixed to the doors on the same day,
and on the 19111 1110 Bishop issued a “Mandatum Inhibitorium ne
quis evellat affixa hujusmodi.” 5 Also on the l9th the Archbishop
appointed a Commission “ad petendum et recipiendum Provoca—
ciones et Appellaciones hujusmodi, et ad dandum Apostolos (i.e.‚
Letters-permissory).''

But the negotiatione made no progress, and the Arehbishop‚ ap-
parently losing patience, issued a Mandate on the 2lst, directed to
Hugh Bridham‚ Archdeacon of Totnes‚ and Canons Ralph Pylatone
and John Cheyne, “ ad citandum Episcopum super detectis in Visita-
cione personaliter responsurum, et in ea parte Canonicam correccionem
subiturum.’' The execution of this Mandate resulted in a serious
