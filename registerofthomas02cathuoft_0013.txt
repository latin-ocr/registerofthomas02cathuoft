PREFAOE.

THoMAs DE BRANTYNGHAM was the Eighteenth Bishop of Exeter.

We know very little of his early years or of the history of his
Family.1 He was one of the sons, apparently the second son, of
John de Brantyngham, who derived his surname from Brantyng-
ham in the East Riding of Yorkshire. We do not know his
mother's name or the date of his birth, or his age at the time of his
death. And, as far as can be ascertained, he is not mentioned in
any record till the year 1361, when he occurs as Treasurer of Calais
and of the County of Guisnes. We know, however, on his own
testimony, that his earlier years were spent at Court; for he tells
us, in his Deed of Appropriation of the Church of Morthoe to the
Dean and Chapter (dated on the Sth of July, 1379, and preserved
in their Archives), that, when he was quite a young man and until
he was promoted to the Episcopate—ab adolescencia nostra usque ad
statum yradus Episcopalis—he had been employed continuously “ in
the service of Edward the Third, the late King, and his Consort‚
Queen Philippa, in their Royal Hall.’' And it appears from the
Issue-Roll of the year 1370 that he had been, for a time, Keeper of
the Wardrobe.² In June, 1369, he was appointed Treasurer of the
Exchequer ; and in the following month he was elected Bishop of
Hereford ; but, the Pope having provided William de Courtenay to
that See, his Election was set aside.

He was, however, soon afterwards elected to the Bishoprick of
Exeter. No record of this Election is known to exist3 but that it
took place is certain, for Pope Urban refers to him as “the Elect
of Exeter’' in his Bu11,3 dated on the 5th of March, 1369-70, in
which he informed him that he had quite recently4 provided
him to the See. This was, certainly, not, as Dr. Oliver says,
“to waive all claim to provision’': the Pope accepted and con-
firmed the choice made by the Chapter of Exeter, and “ pro-

careful work of Mr. Baspgent, who modestly described it to me as a “ tentative
Pedigree.'' It, probably, contains all that we shall ever know about the ⁷
Brantynghams.

*¹ The word used is “ nnper.’' The actual date was only the day before, the
4th of March, as we learn from >cardinal Simon de Langham's letter to
Brantyngham, dated at Rome on the l7th of that mouth (see page 221).
