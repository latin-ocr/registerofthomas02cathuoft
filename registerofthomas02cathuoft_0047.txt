sented to him whether they had been confirmed or not. A glance at
the Itinerary will shew how very numerous these informal “ Centres ''
were; and that he did not neglect his duty is proved incidentallyby two
interesting Entries in his Ordination-Register. In the year 1374 three
candidates from the Island of J ersey presented themselves, and it is
specially recorded that he confirmed them before admitting them,—-
“ Petrum Hurteour et Matheum Clerke‚ de Insula Gersii, Dominus
confirmavit, ac eciam ordinavit ad Primam Tonsuram '’ ; and again,
later in the year, “Matheus Fochun, de Insula Gersii‚'‘ was “or-
dinatus ad Primam Tonsuram, ac eciam confirmatus.”

It will be seen that the Bishop granted many Licences for the
celebration of Divine Service in Chapels and private Oratories ς the
former in small townships and scattered hamlets, the latter within
the Manor-Houses of Nobles and County-Gentlemen‚ and, in a few
instances, within the Parsonage-House 1ῖ861’ἓ.1 The movement in
this direction was on a very large scale; and it has been attributed
by some writers not to any increase in devotion but to a general
relaxation of discipline and the consequent desertion, in many
places, of the Par-ish-Churches in favour of more convenient
arrangements nearer home. It will be found, however, that these
Licences were not granted indiscriminately or reeklessly, merely
because they were asked for, but for short periods, determinable at
the Bishop’s pleasure; and that, as a rule, the Grantees were
required to obtain the consent of the Rector‚ or Vicar, and to
undertake that the privileges and the services of the Parish-
Church should, in no wise, be neglected or infr-inged. The move-
ment began in Bishop Grandisson's time3 and I cannot doubt
that it was due, in large measure, to the impression made on his
subditi throughout the Diocese by his strenuous and devoted
labours at all times, and especially by his heroism and sels-sacrifico
during the aweful visitation of the great Pestilenoe of 1349, the
lessons of which he would assuredly lose no opportunity of enforcing,
calling on those who had been careless heretofore to set their houses
in order, and to direct their thoughts to the great verities of the
eterna] world. “ Sin, autem, malum vobis videtur ut Domino
serviatis, optio vobis datur, . . . ego, autem, et domus mea ser-
viemus Domino.''—Of course, there were many, both clericks and
laymen, who paid little heed to the signs of the times, and were not
reached by this great wave of devotion ς and the Register contains
more than one account of grievous outrages committed by men who

 

 

‘These Entries will be found of great interest and value by students of
local history and genealogy. They are all entered under the dates when the
Licences were granted, and are consequently scattered about all over the
Register, and not easy to find. But I have met this difficulty by preparing a
separate and two-sold Index of Persons and Places, which will be found of
great service (pp. 947—955).
