Sir William Fitz-Waltfer was living at* this time in his Mauor-
House of Langenythe‚1 in the Parish of St. Veep. In the adjoining
Parish of St. WVinnow is the Chapel of St. Nectan 3 still, aud from
time immemorial, a Parochial Chapelry, dependent on the Mother-
Church. It was never a distinct “Ecclesia ⁷¹ (or Rectory), as the
Archbishop was induced to believe 3 and all the above-recited details
as to William the last Rector, the vacancy on his death, the
Patronage, etc, were pure inventions. The Vicarage of St. Winnow
has been from the very beginning of our records in the gift of the
Dean and Chapter.‘2 The Cliapelry has always had its own limits
as in all similar cases3 and it may have occurred to Sir William
that, the Jurisdiction of the Bishop being, for a time, superseded by
the authority of the Primate‚ it might be possible to induce the
latter to believe that those limits were the boundaries of a distinct
Parish of which he was Patron, and to admit and institute his
Presentee. Of course, it was certain that the plot would be un-
masked sooner or later 3 but, probably, this daring Knight hoped to
be able, when the Visitation was over, to persuade Bisliop Brantyng-
ham to accept the novel arrangement, for which he would be able to
plead the Archbishop's authority and the fact that the duly insti-
tuted “ Rector '⁵ was in possession. The scheme failed, as it was bound

to fail, and we hear no more of Robert Babv,³ or of Sir William's

³ The name—a strange one—was not unknown in these parts: Sir John
Baby was Rector of the neighbouring Parish of Duloe, 1519—1523.
