908 THE REGISTER or BISHOP BRANTYNGHAM.

[A-D- The Bishop’s Seal (a representation of which is given in the Frontispiece

1393.] to Part Ι) is attached to the Deed by a cord of green silk. It is a fine
impression in red wax. St. Peter sits under a canopy in the centre,
wearing the tiara ; his right hand raised in benediction, in his left hand
a key. Above, in the centro of the canopy, is a small niche, or panel,
containing a figure of the Blessed Virgin carrying the Holy Child ; and
under the figure of St. Peter, in another niche, is a representation of
the Bishop in the attitude of prayer, vested and mitred, and holding
his Pastoral Staff. On either side of this niche is a shield of arms,
both of which are much rubbed and all but obliterated3 it is possible,
however, to trace in the shield on the right the Arms of the Family of
Brantyngham—“Sable, a fesse subcrenelle between three Katherine
wheels or.'' The other shield may have been of the Arms of the See.
The Legend‚ along the border of the Seal, is “ Sigillum Thome Dei
gracia Exoniensis Episcopi.”

The Seal of Bishop Grandisson (obverse ancl reverse), as appended to
another of the Windsor Deeds, is also represented in the Frontispiece.
An accurate and minutely (letailed description of both seals, 35 used
separately, by Henry Adam de Lyndesheye, Notary-Publick‚ will be
found in that Bishop's Reyz'sz‘er, pp. 1349, 1350,-⁴· que sigilla‚'' 119 tells
us, “bene novi ego Notarius subscriptus.” This was in 1345. It will
be observed that, in the case of the Windsor Deed (dated some sixteen
years later), an impression of the Bishop’s signet-ring appears at the
bottom, on the wax guard. Close inspection shews that it represents
the Blessed Virgin bending over the Holy Child, Who rests on her left
arm. Under the figures is a small shield, badly rubbed, but it is
possible to trace the “ bend '³ of the Bishop's arms. The Legend, which
surrounds the group, has been read “Prosum, Mater Misericordie.’'
The second and third words are quite distinct, but the first word is
hard to read ; “ sum'⁷ is clear, but I doubt the “ Pro.'’ It is, Ι think,
possible, and Ι may add more probable‚ that we should read “ Ego sum.’'
The ring must have been a work of great beauty, the figures and the
lettering being artistically engraved, the drapery most graceful, and
the face of the Blessed Virgin (which is quite perfect) of singular
comeliness.

B1sn012 GRANDISSON correcte the Epistles and Gospels by an
ancient Text.

The following most interesting ‘⁶ Note ⁷' (for a copy of which I
am indebted to Professor Meyer, of Paris), belongs, apparently,
to Bishop Brantyngham’s time. It occurs on the second fly-
leaf of MS. No. 328 in the Library of Gonyille and Caius
College, Cambridge, at the beginning of the MS. (which con-
tains a “ Summa Confessorum '² by Bartholomew of Pisa), and
is in 3 hand of the end of the Fourteenth Century. It will
be observed that Grandisson is referred to as “late Bishop of
Exeter.⁷’
