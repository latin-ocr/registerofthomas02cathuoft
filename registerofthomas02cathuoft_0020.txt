compelled to beat an ignominious retreat. But in Bishop Bran-
tyngham’s case the circumstances were very different: the tables
were turned, in fact3 for the Primate was not only backed up
by a Papa] Mandate, but he was a Devonshire man, a scion

of the influenti-al Family of Courtenay, being the fourth son of ¹

Hugh, second Earl of Devon3 and he knew that, whatever might
happen, he would be well supported. His father had died in 1377 ,·
but his nephew was Earl, and his mother, Margaret, a daughter of
Humphrey de Bohun, Earl of Hereford and of Essex, survived her
husband, and was living close to the Cathedral City. Courtenay
and Brantyngham were very friendly in the old days,· and when
the latter, as I have mentioned above, was detained in London by
affairs of State for more than a year after his Consecration, the
former, who had just been appointed Bishop of Hereford, came
down to Tiverton Castle on several occasions, and acted on behalf
of his brother Bishop, holding several Ordinations for him. But
in 1375 Courtenay was translated to London, and in 1381 to
Canterbury. Like (ἔπι-6611166011, 116 was an energetick, not to say an
exacting PreLate, and he lost no time in secui-ing from the Pope
full authority to visit the Province, and special permission to begin
his Visitation, not in his own Cathedral Church and Diocese, but
wherever he might choose to do so, and also to renew his Visitation
of any Diocese, whether he had completed it or not, before visiting
other Dioceses including his own. He had a particular reason, as
we shall see presently, for obtaining these Apostolick powers and
directions The Pope's Bull was duly issued‚ dated at Rome on the
22nd of November, 13823 and 011 13116 Sth of January, 1383-4, the
Archbishop directed his Mandate to Bishop Brantyngham, sending
him a copy of Pope Urban's Bull, and informing him that, as he
thought it would be advantageous to visit the Diocese of Exeter
first, he was to be expected to arrive in Devonshire before Monday
in the second week of Lent, the 7th of March. The Bishop was
cited to* appear before him on that day, and the Dean and Chapter
and all the dignitaries and clerks of the Cathedral on the following
morning, in the Chapter House.l

Whatever our Bishop may have thought of all this, he seems to
have relied on the good-will of his old friend, and he hastened to fulfil
the Mandate. It reached him, at Chudleigh, 011 the 30th of January;
and 011 13116 lst of February he directed his own Mandate to the
Chapter, and 011 the 4th to the four Archdeacons and the Official of
the Peculiar ‚Iuris-‹liction in Devon, requiring them to take all necess-
ary steps to carry out the Archbishop’s Orders, and to certify the same
to him before the lst of Marc-1152 The Precentor. Hugh de Hycke-
