Earlier in the year, about a month before the Commissary had
commenced his Visitation of the Archdeaconry of Uornwall, an ex-
traordinary attempt to deceive the Archbishop was made by a pro-
minent layman of that County, which can only be regarded as
fraudulent. The offender, evidently, thought that, in the remote
locality in which he lived, he might safely take advantage of the
fact that the authority of the Diocesan Bishop had been, for a time,
suspended, and that the Archbishop‘s Cominissary and his officers
were strangers in that land. For he, actually, ventured to secure
the recognition of a fictitious Benefice, close to his own house, and
to claim the Pati-onage thereos ἕ Accordingly, on the 4th of April,
he sent to the Archbishop a formal Letter of Presentation to a
non-existent “ Rectory‚’'—-

hayle, a few miles north of Bodmin. 'I'hat the Archbishop rested there on the
lSth of August is certain3 for a Citation, in a matrimonial cause, entered in
his Register (fol. 12112), was ‘¹ Data apud le Parke ’² on that day. He appears
to have started from St. Coluinb early in the day, and to have proceeded to
Bodinin, where he dined at the Augustinian Priory, going on to the Peverells
after dinner, and returning on the 20th to hold his Visitation. Ι suspect a
clm-ica] error herc: the scribe should have written “ apud Bodminiam, cnm
Priore, cte.'’ le Pcverclls were devoted to the work of the Church, and
were long held in high honour at Bodmin. Sir Hugh and Sir Thomas were
principal benefactors of tln.¹ Franciscan Convent there, and both were buried
in the Friary Church. This 'l'honias Peverell was the husband of Margaret
Courtenay, daughter of Sir Thomas Courtenay, the Archbishop’s uncle.—-The
account of the Faniily, and of their Arms, given by Lysons is inaccurate.
