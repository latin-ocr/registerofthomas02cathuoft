nothing remained of the Bishop except a considerable portion of
the bones. From the examination of the skull and teetli the

Including the Register of Bishop Edmund de Stafford (which
was published in 1836), Ι have been permitted to give to the
Church and to the Diocese, in eight large and closely printed
Vohunes, the Registers of our Bishops from A.D. 1257 to A.D.
14195 and I record the fact in humble thankfulhess to Him who
has enabled me to accomplish so large a portion of the task which Ι
set myself in 1884, when I began the actual work of transcribing
and editing. It is my earnest desire to complete my task, if God
spares me, by editing the latest of our great medieval Registers‚ the
Register of Bishop Edmund Lacy, whose Episcopate extended from
1420 to 1455‚—a most valuable and interesting Record. My sin-
cere thanks are due, and are hereby tendered, to those who have
loyally supported me in my really arduous work for so many years 32
and 1 must again thank, and with all my heart, the good friends
who have worked for me, affording invaluable help whenever I have
found occasion to ask for it‚—Canon Dalton, of WVindsom Canon
