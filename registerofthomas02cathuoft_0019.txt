PREFAOE. xiii

Roll for the following year we find mention of the purchase of
“ iron-work for the glazing of the windows in the Cloiste1·.'' In the
Roll for 1389-90 it is recorded that the work (which had, apparently,
been suspended in the interval) was going on all through the year :
the iron bars were fixed in the windows, and the pavement, con-
sisting of 1,04O feet of marble, was laid. And now the work was
again suspended, apparently 5 and this time for lack of funds. But
the Bishop was anxious to proceed with it3 and on the 7 th of
February, 1390-1, he appealed to the whole of the Diocese for help.
He wanted money for certain repairs of the Fabrick of the
Cathedral‚ and especially for the completion of the Cloisters ; and
he granted an Indulgence of forty days to all who, being in a state
of grace, should contribute to the Fund which he was raising, or
should remember in their Wills “the Mother and Mistress of all
their Churches.'' 1 There appears to be no record of the result of this
appeal3 but the fragmentary remains of the south Cloister prove
that that section of the work was executed in Bishop Stafford’s
time, and the Roll for 1397-8 shews that the executors of Bishop
Brantyngham‚ exercising the discretion reposed in them by the
Bishop’s Will—“ pro anime mee salute, prout eis melius videbitur
expedire ’'—contributed five pounds “for stones to pave the
Cloisters.'' His principa] work on the Fabrick of the Cathedral-
Church was, of course, the erection of the fine screen‚ extending
across the whole of the west front, of which, and of the reasons for
erecting it, I have already given an account, which need not be
repeated here.2

Perhaps the most striking incident in Brantyngham's Episcopal
career was the Visitation of the Diocese in 13834 by the Metro-
politan, William de Courtenay. It will be remembered that in
1332 Archbishop Mepeham attempted to visit this Diocese, and
actually made his way to Exeter‚ where, at the very gate of the
Close‚ he was repelled by Bishop Grandisson‚ who resented his in-
terference as mischievous‚ for reasons which I have 'already
explained in my Preface to that Prelate's Register.3 Mepeham had
no one to back him in these parts, and he was simply driven away,

Blakeborne was a generous benefactor; and to him we owe the rebuilding, in
1390, of the great east. window of the Choir‚ a· noble work in itself, but in-
congruous in style. Archdeacon Freeman‚ in his History of the Cathedral
(p. 63), refers in severe terms to its “later and inferior style . . . to the
detriment of the building.” He calls it an “unhappy insertion.'' “It is
probable,’' he adds, “that Bitton’s window herc. no doubt of great beauty,
had become much decayed; as we have notices in 1374-1377 of repairs
about ‘the front of the Church ’ which always in those days meant the east
end.'’ We, also, learn, from the Fabrick-Roll of 1392-3, that Blakeborne
gave 597 feet of marble towards the re-paving of the Choir.
