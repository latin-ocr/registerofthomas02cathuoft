vided '' accordingly 3 the King, we cannot doubt, using his influence
on behalf of his faithful servant. In the same Bull ,the Pope tells
the Elect that, as a special act of favour, he complies with his
petition that he should be permitted to choose his own Consecrator,
and to nominate the two or three assisting Β1811οΡ8.1

He was consecrated, in the Chapel of the Manor of Stepney, on
Sunday the l2th of May, 1370, by Simon de Sudbury, Bishop of
London‚2 the assisting Prelates being Geoffrey, Archbishop of
Damascus, and John, Bishop of Ayobana.³ The Temporalities were
restored to him on the thh of May.4

Brantyngham, like Stapeldon, was a Statesman-Bishop, a fact
which cannot be regarded as otherwise than a misfortune for his
Diocese, especially when we bear in mind the absolute devotion of
his great predecessor to his proper work as a Bishop throughout his
long Episcopate, the memory of which and the marked contrast
between the two men must have caused the change to be keenly
felt, as for more than a year after his Consecration he was absent
from his Diocese, detained in London by his official duties as
Treasurer. The necessary Ordinations, five in number-‚⁵ were held
by William de Courtenay, then Bishop of Hereford, in the Parish-
Church of Tiverton, where he was staying with his relatives in
Tiverton Castle, close to the Church3 the Bishop himself holding
four Ordinations in the interval, two in the Conventual Church of
WVestminster and two in the Parish Church of Faringdon, in the
Diocese of VVinchester, greatly, we may be sure, to the incon-

³ A Diocese in partibus infidelium, which has not been identified. Oliver
attempts to solve the difficulty by calling him ‘⁶ Bishop of Bayoune.'’ But the
name of the then Bishop of that Diocese was not “John,” and it is certain
that 'our Bishop of “ Ayobana '³ served as a Suffragan-Bishop within the
Pr?‘15¹n⁰⁰ ot* C4anterbury as early as 1366, and died in London in 1381.

³ Of these the fifth was held in December, 1371, the Bishop, after his
first short visit to his Diocese, having returned, early in October, to London,
where he remained till May, 1372.

⁶ See Dr. Oliver's Lives of the Bishops of Emeter, page 91.—He was appointed,
on the 19th of November, 1386, one of the Council of Regen0y‚ with the Duke

of Gloucester at their head, by which King Richard was deprived of all power
till its dissolution in 1389.
