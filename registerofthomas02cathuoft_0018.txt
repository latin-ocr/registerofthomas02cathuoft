apparently, to leave it again. Resting for a few days at Farfflgdon,
on his way, he reached Clyst (probably early) in October, and re-
maine‘j there, or at his Manor of Chudleigh and at Exeter, till the
middle of April, 1390, when he commenced what was destined to be
his last Visitation. It occupied nearly five months, more or less
continuously3 and it is characteristick of the man that, his debility
and unfitness for arduous work notwithstanding, he visited, as in
former years, many scattered parishes, desiring‚ perhaps, to make
such atonement as was in his power for his frequent and prolonged
absences from his proper work. That this was no informal visita-
tion, however, is shewn by an incidental reference to it—“ pendente
nostra Visitacione inexpleta ’'—in a document dated at Crediton on
the 24th of September. And, nOW‚ his health, which had been of
late precarious, finally broke down. He betook himself, imme-
diately after the Visitation, to Clyst, his favourite abode throughout
his Episcopate,· and there he lived in retirement till, in 1394, the
end came.

The Cathedral, as we have seen, was practically completed by
Bishop Grandisson,1 but much important work still remained to be
done, externally, and Bishop Brantyngham lost no time in setting
about it. The cloisters were unfinished. They were begun by
Bishop Grandisson, who certainly completed the north section‚ and
probably the east section as far as, and including, the doorway of
the Chapter—Hense. Nothing remains of his work, however, beyond
a few deftly carved stones and some mutilated fragments, but enough
remains to shew that the work was, undoubtedly, his. The great
flying-buttresses of the Nave, six in number, intersected the northern
site 3 hut the resourceful architect overcame the difficulty by con-
structing arch-ways through each buttress. It is, indeed, lamentable
that, except for a few traces of his masterly mode of dealing with
such obstructions, a work so interesting and so beautiful as the
fragments shew that it was should have been utterly and wantonly
dest1·0yed.2 Unfortunately, our later Fabrick-Rolls give but scanty
information as to the details of works in progress, and no mention
is made of the Cloisters from 1371 to 1380. But the work was,
probably, going on all the time ,· and it must have been well
advanced by 1380, for it is recorded on the Roll for that year that
workmen were employed “circa opus claustrale,'² and that eight
fothers of lead were used “in coopertura novi claustri ’' 3 and on the
