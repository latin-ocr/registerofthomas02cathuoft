pretended Patronage. In his long indictment of Courtenay's pro-
ceedingS, dated at Clyst on the 2316 of April, 1384, the Bishop
refers to this strange affair, and states the case fully and clearly,¹-—

“ Atque quondam Dominum Robertum Baby, presbiterum pretensum ejusdem
Exoniensis Diocesis, ad Capellam Sancti Nectani, infra Parochiam Ecclesia
Parochialis Sancti Winnoci, in Cornubia, prefate Diocesis, Decano et Capitulo
Ecclesie Cathedralis Exonie, et ipsi Ecclesie Cathedrali, salva Porcione Vi-
carii Perpetui in eadem, unite et annexe, ac in proprios usus perpetuo possi-
dende concesse, cum suis juribus et pertinenciis universis, notorie situatam,
atque ab eadem Ecclesia Sancti Winnoci Parochiali et Matrice notorie de-
pendentem, eidemque annexam et unitam tanquam ad Ecclesiam Paro-
chialem Matricem et per se stantem nec aliqualiter dependentem, ad pre-
sentacionem Domini Willelmi Fitzwatere, Militis, ejusdem Ecclesie pretense,
ymmo veraciter Capelle.‚ ut pretenditur Patroni, cum non sit, de facto
admisit, et Rectorem instituit in eadem, cum omnibus suis juribus et perti-
nenciis universis.”

There are many references in the Archbishop's Register to the
details of his Administration of the Diocese both before and after
the submission of the contending Prelate on the 2nd of July.
Much of the work was, of course, mere routine—work‚ such as the
proving of Wins, the sequestration of the fruits of vacant Benefices,
Institutions to Benefices, sundry Commissions‚ and the like. The
Wills were few in number and of no particular interest. I may
mention that of John Cryspyn, the Rector of Ashcombe,2 which was
proved at Exminster on the 24th of March, 1383-4 ; he bequeathed
to William Hughe, Rector of Mambead, “j togam longam vel armi-
lausam longa1n‚'' to John Graperay “j capucium,'’ and to his servant,
William Clerke, the residue of his estate. There was some conten-
tion between the Prelates over the Will of William de VVolastone,
Rector of Tawstock. The Bishop sequestrated his effects on the
llth of April,3 and on the 16th the Archbishop repeated the process.
On the thh the Bishop‚ finding that a contest was inevitable, had
excommunicated certain persons who had laid hands on the seques·
trated effects, and issued his Mandate that no one should presume
to admit a clerk to the vacant Benefice. On the lssth of April the
will was proved before him at Clyst, and on the llth of Ma),v he
instituted Walter Parker, of Olneye, to the Rectory.4 It does not
appear that the Archbishop interfered further in the matter. There
were, however, several collisions between the Archbishop and the
Diocesan Bishop when Benefices became vacant, and it is clear ‘chat
the former was not always allowed to have his own way; the
Patrons expected to be heard, and not always in vain. On the
3lst of March, the Prior and Convent of Merton (in the Diocese of
WVinchester) presented John Avery to the Rectory of ST. LAURENOE,
