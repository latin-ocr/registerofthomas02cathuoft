took in the concerns of his Diocese.'' In those Volumes we are
able to trace his mox-emenus, and to note all his more important
acts, from the beginning of his Episcopate till its close.

He Set out for Exeter early in May, 1371, passing through
VVinchester (where he spent several days) and Dorchester‚ and
reaching Newenham Abbey towards the end of June. On the 29th
of June he left the Abbey for Clyst, one of his Mauors, within
easy reach of his Cathed1·al—Clmrch; and his first work, as in the
case of his predecessors, was to visit and inspect his other Manors
in that neighbourhood,—Crediton on the 4th of J uly, Paignton on
the l5th, Chudleigh on the 20th, Crediton again for a few days in
August, and Bishop's Tawton on the 20th of that month. A day
or two later he started for Cornwall, reaching St. Germans on the
24th, and the little township of Marazion, at the other end of the
County, on the 28th. On the same day he proceeded, by way of
Helston, to his Manor of Penryn and the adjacent College of
Glasney; and on the lst of September we find him at Bodmin. He
visited, also, his Manors of Poutone and Lawhitton, and on seven
occasions admitted many young men to the First Tonsure, as he
hurried along. Of course, all this must be regarded as a “flying
visit ’' rather than a formal Visitation3 but it enabled him to shew
himself to large numbers of his people, who, remembering the
strenuous times of Grandisson, must have been anxious, at least, to
see their new Bishop3 and certainly, his activity was conspicuous,
for in the course of a fortnight he traversed the County in all
directions, encountering formidable hills everywhere, and roads
which we should not think worthy of the name. On the 9th of
September we find him at Clyst, and from the l4th of that month
till the 22nd at Exeter, where, on the 20th, he held his first General
Ordination in the Cathedral. A few days later, he returned to
London‚ where he remained till the middle of May, 1372 ς visiting
in the interval his Manors in Surrey, Sussex, and Hampshire, and
the King’s Free Chapel of Bosham, of which, as Bishop of Exeter,
he was Ordinary. On the 22nd of May we find him again at Clyst,
holding his second General ordination in the Manor-Chape13 and
then, after spending a few days at the Palaee, in the course of
which he Visited the Cathedral,¹ he set out on a second and General
Visitati0n‚² in which he was more or less occupied for nearly a year.
As on the former occasion, he did not spare himself ; and those who
know the country will understand how arduous his work must have
been, when they learn that, between the lst of June and the 31st
