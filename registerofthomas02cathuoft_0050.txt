xl , PREFAOE.

indebted for the eareful and exhaustive extr-acts from the Register
of Arohbishop Courtenay which have enabled me to enrich this
Prefaee with a full account of the Metropolitieal Visitation of 13843
an event which, strange to say, is not so much as mentioned by
Dr. Oliver in his â€œLife'' of Bishop Brantyngham, though many of
the Documents, it will be seen, are included in that Prelate's
Register.
