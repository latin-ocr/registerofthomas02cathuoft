absence in London in September and October) till the 27 th of June,
1377, rather more than a year; but, this time, he visited few,
if any, distant places, remaining at Exeter, and in its immediate
neighbourhood, so as to be ready for any emergency. The King
died on the 2lst of June, and at the end of the mqnth our Bishop
proceeded to London, where he remained till the end of the year,
and (except for occasional short absences on the business of the
State) throughout the years 1378—1380. He had been re-appointed
to the Treasurership on the Accession of Richard II in 1377, and
the times were so critical that his presence in London was as
necessary as ever. In February, 1380—1‚ he was released from an
Office the all-absorbing duties of which must have sorely tried and
embarrassed the Bishop of so remote a Diocese 3 and it is interesting
to find that he at once returned to his proper and long suspended
work, leaving London early in March, commencing his General
Visitation in the Cathedral at the end of the month,l and resuming,
after his customary manner, informa] visits to every part of
Devon and Cornwall, in which work he was engaged almost con-
tinuously till he was again summoned to London at the end of the
year. Returning to Clyst in March he remained in the Diocese,
except for three short (but, of course, necessary) visits to London,
till the end of 1382. Though he was no longer Treasurer, the
advice and help of so experienced and trusty a Statesman could not
be dispensed wit-h, and he was required to attend Pal-liaments and
the Councils of the King 3 but his Register shews that he was most
anxious that his Diocese should not be neglected 3 and, although his
absences were frequent and involved long and costly journeys, he
was careful that they should be as brief as possible, and, practically‚
his whole time was devoted to his Episcopal work till the end of
1388. On one of these occasions, when Parliament met on the
lst of October, 1386, and the Council of Regency referred to above,
on which our Bishop was appointed to serve, was formed, he evi-
dently left for Clyst as soon as he could get away, and there plunged
at once, as so often before, into the arduous work of visiting his
Diocese from end to endsz On the 4th of May, 1389, he was again
appointed Treasurer, and we find him in London from about that
date till the end of August. But he had had enough, and more
than enough, of affairs of State, and he lost no time in securing
release from them. He was, now, an old man, and infirm 3 and on
the 29th of August he obtained from the King, not only release
from his high office, but also Letters of Exemption for life from all
attendance in Parliaments and in the Council-Chamber. With as
little delay as possible he set out for his Diocese once more, never,
