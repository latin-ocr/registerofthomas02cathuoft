23rd, annexing a schedule containing a complete List of the Canons,
Vicars, and all others who held any office in the cathedral, in com-
pliance with the Archbishop's request to that effect ; and the Arch-
dcacons also certified before the appointed day.l On the 3rd of
March the Bishop certified the Archbishop that they were ready
to receive him with due reverence and submission, prepared to obey
him in all things lawful.2 The Archbishop arrived, a day or two
later, at the Manor—House, Exminster, his mother's abode, which he
made his head-quarters throughout the Visitation³; and, finding
that the Bishop was absent, he issued a Commission to his Chan-
cellor, Adam de Mottrum, on the 5th, “ad continuandum negocium
Visitacionis.'' The proceedings were commenced, iu the Chapter-
House, on Monday the 7th, when there appeared, before the Com-
missary, Hugh de Hyckelynge the Precentor, Robert Broke the
Treasurer, the Archdeacons of Barnstaple and Totnes, and six of
the Canons. They waited for the Bishop, but he did not come ; and
the proceedings were, therefore, adjourned until the 8th, and then
until the following day.4 On Monday the l4th the Archbishop
came, in the morning.⁵ He was on horseback, and was received, in
solemn form, by the Clergy, Regular and Secular, outside Exe-Bridge.
They conducted him to the Cathedral Cemetery, where he alighted
from his horse and the Bishop met him—“Pontificalibus indutus,

² He wrote from Salisbury, on his homeward journey from London, where
he had spent a few days3 a hurried visit, rendered necessary, no doubt, by
urgent affairs of State at a most critical time, but probably not altogether
unconnected with some anxiety as to Courtenay’s movements and intentione.
It will be remeinbered that, under similar circumstances, Bishop Grandisson
consulted the King and Queen, and secured their active 'intervention in his
impending· struggle with Mepeham.
