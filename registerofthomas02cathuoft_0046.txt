xxxvi PREFAOE.

Indexes¹ which Ϊ have provided will, I hope, be found by the
Student sufficient for all purposes. It may be well, however, to
direct attention, in this place, to a few matters 01 exceptional
interest.

Ι have already shewn that, although, like Stapeldon, he was a
“ statesman-Bishop‚'' it cannot be said that he neglected his Diocese.
It is true that he was frequently called away from his Diocesan duties ς
but there is abundant evidence to shew that, all difficulties notwith-
standing, his heart was in what he felt to be his proper work, and
that he spared neither expense nor labour in his endeavours to
make all necessary provision 101· its efficient accomplishment. There
appears to be a general impression that he neglected the regular
adininistration 01 the Sacrament 01 Confirmati0n3 and, indeed, this
charge has been freely brought against all our Medieval Bishops. I
arn sure that it cannot be justified. It is true that their Registers
contain no references to “ Confirmasson-centres,'’ such as we have
been accustomed to 111 modern times3 and there are no “ Confirma—
tion-Lists.'' But there are numerous incidental references to this
important part of a Bishop's work, and I fail to see that we are
entitled to expect to find anything else. It is, really, absurd to
suppose that such a man as Grandisson could be guilty 01 such
neglect; he was always in his Diocese3 and we know that, when
he was over-burdened with work, it was his wont to commission
another Bishop, who was specially charged with this important
duty. John &Vare <or wari-e), a Bishop in partibus infidelium,
was consecrated in 1354, and served in this office more or less
continuously, in fact whenever his services were wanted, until
the Bishop’s death. And Brantyngham continued to employ
him both 101· Ordinations and Oonfirmations, and for other less
important Episcopal Functions.² In February, 1378-9, for instance,
he commissioned him “ad confirmandum pueros baptizatos, in
Civitate et Diocesi Exonie, ac precipue in Archidiaconatu Cornubi-
ensi '⁷——always a very difficult part 01 the Diocesan's work, down to
Bishop Teinple's time. Also, a ·year later,-—“ad celebrandum
Ordines ; necnon ad confirmandum pueros.'⁷ And again, in Septem-
ber, 1385‚-“ad quoscumque pueros non confirmatos confirmandum.”
Moreover, although Bishop Brantyngham constituted no formal
‘⁶ Centres '⁷ for confirmation, there can be no doubt, that, like his
Predecessors, he provided the “pueri '² (the boys and girls) of his
Diocese with abunda-nt opportunities. The Regi-ster of Ordinations
shews that in every part 01 his Diocese, often in the most remote
country-villages, he was accustomed to admit large numbers 01 youths
to the First Tonsure 3 and it was his duty to ask all who were pre-
